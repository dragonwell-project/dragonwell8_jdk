/**
 * Implementation of symmetric coroutines. A Coroutine will take part in thread-wide scheduling of coroutines. It transfers control to
 * the next coroutine whenever yield is called.
 * <p>
 * Similar to {@link Thread} there are two ways to implement a Coroutine: either by implementing a subclass of Coroutine (and overriding
 * {@link #run()}) or by providing a {@link Runnable} to the Coroutine constructor.
 * <p>
 * An implementation of a simple Coroutine might look like this:
 * <p>
 * <hr>
 * <blockquote>
 *
 * <pre>
 * class Numbers extends Coroutine {
 * 	public void run() {
 * 		for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
 * 			System.out.println(i);
 * 			yield();
 * 		}
 * 	}
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * </blockquote>
 * <hr>
 * <p>
 * A Coroutine is active as soon as it is created, and will run as soon as control is transferred to it:
 * <p>
 * <blockquote>
 *
 * <pre>
 * new Numbers();
 * for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
 * 	yield();
 * </pre>
 *
 * </blockquote>
